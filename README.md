======================

Playing video games or launching other programs from XBMC? This autohotkey script maps a button of your choosing to close the program and return to XBMC, or start XBMC if it isn't running.

Instructions:
1. Download autohotkey: http://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download and run JoyStickTest.ahk and map out all buttons and thumbsticks. Buttons should be the same as XBMC but may not be.
3. Edit one number in controller-mapping-for-xbmc.ahk to map that key to send Alt+F4 to close a program and return to XBMC, or start if it isn't running.

As you may know, "A programmer is just a tool which converts caffeine into code". Thanks in advance!
